# NeoStart
My personal startpage.

Demo: https://faerch.dev/startpage/demo/

The startpage is written in HTML + JS + CSS, and do not require any database or serverside code.
Feel free to modify it, and use it as you want, but please provide a link to this repository :)
The startpage is inspired by https://github.com/cadejscroggins/tilde.

Features:
- Easy Google search.
- Random beautiful background images from unsplash.
- Fast search on your favorite websites.
- A fancy clock.
- Weather temperature display on your location.
- Display friendly quotes depending on the time.

And it can all be customized!
